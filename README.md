> I'm sorry you had an accident,
> 

No. My ex had passed away by car accident. I have had a mental issue from that moment. This is explanation for being terrible right now.

> But please Dante, don't push me away from you just because you feel something.
> 

Okay. I’ll try. I tend to break relationship up right before than it gets deep. because I can’t handle to let it go.

> Tell me if you don't want to have anything to do with me anymore because it's not good for you to have contact with me.
> 

Of course, I like to chat. Be my guest.

> you are aware that you are flirting with me, right?
> 

I don’t know what flirting is exactly. I’ve never considered you in a way of romance. I am likely to fall in love but I barely know your face and voices because we just met. even online! 

> but you are also aware that it will probably stay that way. because the distance is so great
> 

I don’t think so. I believe in the power of destiny. who knew the future? I’m open to everything. Dante Lowë. why not???????????? The countless of probable outcomes rule us. I guess.

> we are so different
> 

Yes. clearly! that’s the point. we share our differences and understand each other.

> I want to know from you what exactly you want from me? what should I do? what not to do should I leave you alone? should I help you?
> 

You are an wonderful lady. So be Sylvia as always. but sometimes you were mean to me. so we talk, we solve problems. okay?

> I don't want to be the center of your life, that wouldn't be possible at all.
> 

This time. from me. What makes so sure about that? let it be my worries.

> I just don't know how you are flirting with me and saying flattering things one moment, but being so absent the other moment.
> 

I’m Dante. I do what I do. I think this is your imagination.

> those are my thoughts right now.
> 

I really appreciate.
